* Enabled loading (up to six) slit-jaw image files simultaneously
* Implemented Stokes scaling to specified continuum position
* Implemented off-line center spectral zoom (e.g., to only 
  positive or negative Doppler velocities)
* Reverted to checkbox buttons for selecting main diagnostics
* Fixed miscellaneous bugs (WINDOW_LARGE keyword behavior, 
  non-necessary pop up windows, header variable parsing, initial 
  scaling with NaN-only first frame(s), a.o.)
